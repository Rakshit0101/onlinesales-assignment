# onlinesales-assignment

This repository contains the code for the Online Sales assignment, implemented in Java. The assignment includes two tasks: `Task1` and `Task2`. 

## Task1: EventSimulator
The `EventSimulator` class, located in `src/main/java/onlinesales/task1`, simulates an event based on given biasness. It accepts a map of possible outcomes along with their probabilities and generates outcomes based on the provided probabilities.

## Task2: EquationResolver
The `EquationResolver` class, located in `src/main/java/onlinesales/task2`, resolves mathematical equations using a web API. It accepts multiple mathematical expressions, sends them to the API, and displays the results.

## Test Code
Test cases for `Task1` and `Task2` are implemented in the respective test classes located in `src/test/java/onlinesales/task1` and `src/test/java/onlinesales/task2`. These test classes ensure the correct functionality of the main code by validating the expected outcomes.
